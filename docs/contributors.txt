Charles Mcdonald
================

Released his SMS emulator since 0.9 under the GPLv2+.
It stayed like so until after version 1.5 (source code to version 1.5 got lost unfortunately but we still have SmSPlus-GX thankfully).
After version 1.5, he decided to switch it to a non-commercial license, turning it proprietary again.
(The reason being he got legal threats from some companies using his emulator)

He also contributed modifications to sn76489.c, i contacted him and he told me it fell under the same license as Maxim's.

ekeeke
======
He worked on SMSPlus-GX, with several improvements such as improved accuracy, fixing bugs with most games etc...
It was originally designed for the Gamecube/Wii.
https://github.com/ekeeke/smsplus-gx

This fork also has code for Colecovision but Colecovision support seems to be a bit spotty and requires a BIOS.
The overscan code got removed because it was not useful and little to no SMS games make use of it.

Alekmaul
=========
He came up with the bitmap_scale function. That function is solely used for the menu and unscaled.

drowsnug95
==========

Came up with upscale_160x144_to_212x144 and upscale_160x144_to_212x160.
License should fall under the GPLv2+.

Harteex
========
Came up with the TGA font loading code and he converted the fonts to a c array with bin2h.

dmitrysmagin
=============

- Menu code based on his fork sms_sdl-rzx50 available here :
https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/sms_sdl-rzx50

I suspect he also did the SDL sound code that was found in FBA-SDL.
That code is so much better than what we used to have so thank you Dmitry !

exmortis@yandex.ru, joyrider
============================
They are mostly responsible for making the initial port of Dingux-SMS for the Dingoo.
I don't think there's much of their code left, if any.
The SDL sound code was very poor and got entirely replaced by the one found in FBA-SDL.

PocketSprite
============
Patches to switch SMS Plus to EightyOne's Z80 CPU core. (based itself on FUSE)
https://github.com/PocketSprite/8bkc-gamegear/commit/cd3510d12feb8f922c0505a2a47e4a58b5fef9f0

Contrarely to what they say, it is based on SMS Plus 0.9, not SMS Plus 1.3 with the TMS support and all.
The fact that it uses sms_frame (rather than system_frame from SMS Plus 1.2+) further confirms this.
This patch switches to a GPLv2 Z80 Core so it can be used for commercial use, which is what they did.
Anyway, those patches wouldn't work as is on SMS Plus 1.2 but they did tell me how i should switch to another Z80's core.
And for that, i am very grateful.

Most of my issues with it were related to irq & cpureadmap (which turns out, required minor changes for it to work)

EightyOne ZX81
==============

https://github.com/PocketSprite/8bkc-gamegear/commit/cd3510d12feb8f922c0505a2a47e4a58b5fef9f0
(Based on that)
https://github.com/libretro/81-libretro/tree/master/81/z80

See PocketSprite's patches. This CPU core is much less accurate and is unable to run games like Dizzy and some SG-1000 games.
Juergen's z80 cpu core on the other hand, does not suffer from these issues.

I am planning on removing this core in the future due to how crap it is but i will leave it for now.

Juergen Buchmueller
====================

He made the z80 core for SMS Plus and later released an updated one for MAME under the BSD-3 license.
He declined releasing the old z80's core so i had to reconvert the MAME core for our use in SMS Plus GX.

CrabEmu
========
https://github.com/OpenEmu/CrabEmu-Core/blob/master/sound/sn76489.c
https://github.com/OpenEmu/CrabEmu-Core/blob/master/sound/ym2413.c

The ym2413 & sn76489 sound emulators from CrabEmu were used as the stock ones provided with SMS_Plus did not clarify their licenses.
ym2413.c is based on MAME's GPLv2 code, with some modifications that switches it to C as well as provide some functions to use it more easily.
The changes are also released under the GPLv2.

sn76489.c by CrabEmu does not seem to be based upon any code other than Maxim's documentation and some snippets of code.
It shares little to no similarity with Maxim's code and it is also released under the GPLv2.

Gameblabla, me
==============

I switced most variables to c99 data types: this fixed rendering issues on 64-bits and somewhat broken PSG sound for Maxim's PSG core.
I also improved PocketSprite's EightyOne patches for making sure it works with the newer SMS Plus version. (not as straightfoward as it might seem !)
Disabled collision check for 9th sprite : doing so passes Flubba's test.
Fixed support for 256 pages. This fixes Bad Apple SMS. (also added it to the ROM database list as it requires PAL timings)

I made specific changes for each devices, like the RS-97. They can be found under their own subfolders in src/ports.
I'm also responsible for making MAME's z80 core work with SMS Plus GX. (it was similar but with some improvements)
Another thing i did was to port it to several sound APIs such as ALSA, OSS, Portaudio, libao and pulseaudio.
I am releasing the changes under the GPLv2+, just to make things clear.

Maxim
=====
He's the author of sn76489.c (not crabemu's one), a sn76489 emulator.
Contacted by email, he said that it was released along with in_vgm as a whole under this license :
You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:
1. You let me know if you distribute it (any included files or anything derived from them), and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.

Clause 1 is problematic and potentially makes it non-free. (He did say that he plans to relicense it)
As a failsafe, CrabEmu's PSG emulation is also provided.
