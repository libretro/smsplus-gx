BreakThru! (Game Gear)
======================

Unpatched version does not actually work on real hardware it seems. (tested on Megadrive with GG2SMS and reverted patch)
The patch just NOPs out the DI/EI calls to 0x00.

It is apparently supposed not to work on real hardware without the patch, see :
https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX/issues/399

One might wonder if this was intentional or only happens under very specific circumstances.
(Leftover register values ?)

Madou Monogatari I (Game Gear)
===============================

Intro with character waking up from nightmare has rendering issues with the sprite.
This part is sensitive to the timing of the rendering scanline.

Currently, this is partially fixed except during the short time when the sprites scroll into the background.

Sonic's Edusoft (Master System)
===============================

Relies on VDP register 1 being set by the BIOS.
I looked at what the BIOS outputs to that register and it's 0xE except for one BIOS setting it to 0xC.
The latter of which would still make it work on Sonic's Edusoft but seemingly break other games also.

Because of this flaw, the Megadrive cannot run this game unpatched and it appears that
the Game Gear and Mark 3 should not be able to run this either.

Fantastic Dizzy (Master System)
===============================

Uses the higher resolution modes found on PAL models. Very sensitive to timings.
The game also needs proper emulation of HALT and a fairly accurate Z80 interpreter overall.
If you don't get the timing rights for the VDP, you will get some rendering issues.
The most common one being the flickering bar at the top.

There are also other issues as well, such as the fact that this game won't work properly in NTSC mode
so this should be done accordingly.

Sonic 1 FM (Master system, homebrew patch)
==========================================

The game can switch on the fly to FM or PSG.
One must make sure that the FM code is not being emulated when disabled as otherwise this can lead
to higher CPU usage for nothing.

Some earlier versions of it were also suffering from timing issues on Japanese Mark 3 models.
(I believe this is partly the reason why games just use one chip at a time, except for the Japanese SMS bios)
These have since been fixed but i wonder if we should emulate this someday ?

Dallyeora Pigu Wang (Master System)
===================================

Uses the Z80's R register for selecting the CPU team. (it is used as some sort of a randomizer, a few other games do this also)
If we ever add another CPU dynarec to it, this is a good test case.
ROM file size is also not a power of 2.

Alibaba and 40 Thieves, Block Hole (Master system)
==================================================

These games will only work on consoles with RAM not being cleared.
A quick fix is simply to clear the memory with 0xF0.

This means that only the Japanese Master system can run these games.
The overseas version clear the memory (0x00) but this also means that they can't run these games at all.

Shadow Dancer, Ace of Aces (SMS)
=================================

Both rely on the BIOS setting the Z80's SP register to 0xDFF0.
If this is not being done, Shadow Dancer will be stuck on a black screen.

Rainbow Islands (Master System, PAL)
====================================

Relies on memory area $df90 - $dffb being 0.
On Consoles without a BIOS (Megadrive, Game Gear, Mark 3), area will most likely be random thus the game will lock up
before you can reach the final level.

This is fixed in the Brazilian release.

PGA TOUR Golf (Game Gear)
=========================

Expects the low 5 bits of the VDP status register to not be zero. 
https://www.smspower.org/Development/PGATourGolf-SMS

Great Baseball (1985), Pit Pot and Teddy Boy Blues (Japan)
==========================================================

These have control issues when a FM sound unit is plugged in.

Wanted (SMS)
============

Incompatible FM game. (Won't boot, red screen of death)

Zool (GG, SMS)
==============

From https://www.smspower.org/Development/Zool-SMS :

Zool (SMS and GG versions) expects the VBlank bit (VDP status register bit 7) to be set several cycles
before the VBlank IRQ actually occurs because of the following polling routine which can execute with interrupts enabled:

wait_for_vblank:
    in a,(bf)
    and a,a
    jp p,wait_for_blank
    ret
